#A jury-man's judgement upon the case of Lieut. Col. John Lilburn: proving, by well-grounded arguments, both to his own and every jury-man's conscience, that they may not, cannot, ought not finde him guilty upon the Act of Parliament made for his banishment, and to be a felon for returning into England. That if any should or shall be tempted or misled so to do, they are notorious murtherers by the law of England, it being the worst of crimes that is done by colour of law. And, that it is as great a wickedness for any, (either judges, or sheriffs, or any other person) to have a hand in his death upon that Act, as wilfully to murther him.#
